- [x] Add fast failure checks (preview script sanity request + config validation)
- [x] Document/verify updated workflow
- [ ] Verify dev-host `/api/health` aggregate payload (pc1 workstation)
- [ ] Capture diagnostics screenshot/log snippets for troubleshooting matrix
- [ ] Wire /test/agents observability panel + publish via mcp-agents/mcp-devops
  - [ ] Publish refreshed SPA bundle into `/www/test/agents` and surface MCP data blocks
  - [ ] Deploy the `mcp-agents` service (compose entry, env, PM2) onto pc2-worker
  - [ ] Register the new `mcp-agents` provider with MCP0 + document client hookup
  - [ ] Expose preview/mcp workflows to smoke-test `mcp-agents` (preview-agents workflow, health probe, logs)

- [ ] Register MCP providers (glama, vaja, meeting, instrans) with MCP0 and confirm `/providers` refresh
